# Kruskal-Graph-TourGuide-Project
This C++ program generates a shortest path route to visit all the destination in a given city/country.

## Working
This program takes a graph as input i.e. we insert the map of a city/country as a graph and the important destinations as its nodes. We then use Kruskal's algorithm to generate a minimum spanning tree which in turn is the shortest way to visit all nodes (destinations). This program has essential hardcoded UI for to get other information such as total distance, list of all destination, etc.
